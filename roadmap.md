## urgent - to figure out

## doubts to figure out 
how to make the thumbnail responsive
    if its just an image, then have images of different sizes and media query whichever fits the ratio?
    --> take thumbnail pictures of 4:3 ratio 
    --> fix thumbnail div to maintain the 4:3 ratio
    -->

1. weird sliding resizing thing for thumbnail, when you slowly reduce the length of the screen
2. how to make the project items in a row the same size and bottom right align the logos
3. need to reorganize nesting of headings and sections 

## roadmap for now
features that can be added
* a bottom arrow at the end of each section that scrolls nicely to the next section
* add an animation (like a metallic shine/reflection thing) to the arrow every x seconds 
* create a function that helps you insert any project without too many clicks

## logos 
* if need to change them, replace the same name so the webpage updates accordingly

## testing notes
* open this on firefox, chrome, edge, mobile device
* try zooming in and out
* try using screen readers
* check for accessibility <!-- todo -->
