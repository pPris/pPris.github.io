# features to add
- [ ] applying background colour to some sections
- [ ] scroll to next section button
- [ ] add tooltips to logos
- [ ] add 'take me to website' button on hover 
- [ ] modify the hover button for touch devices

- [ ] add two more projects
- [ ] try using boottrap row 

## doubts to figure out 
- [ ] how to make the project items in a row the same size and bottom right align the logos
- [ ] may need to reorganize nesting of headings and sections 

## roadmap for now
features that can be added
* a bottom arrow at the end of each section that scrolls nicely to the next section
* add an animation (like a metallic shine/reflection thing) to the arrow every x seconds 
* create a function that helps you insert any project without too many clicks --> too much js can slow down website

## performance
- [ ] minified css/js 
## logos 
* if need to change them, replace the same name so the webpage updates accordingly

## testing notes
* open this on firefox, chrome, edge, mobile device
* try zooming in and out
* try using screen readers
* check for accessibility <!-- todo -->

## columns cheat sheet
3 in a row on medium screen
* col-md-4

2 in a row centered below a column of 3
* col-md-4 col-md-offset-2
