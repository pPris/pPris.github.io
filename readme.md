## purpose of this project
supposed to form my proper coding portfolio
giving this a try on vscode instead of codepen.io
need to sync to github eventually - remove identifying info from urls first


## urgent - to figure out 
mobile responsiveness
* caption height blocks the words when the size is small




## doubts to figure out 
how to make the thumbnail responsive
    if its just an image, then have images of different sizes and media query whichever fits the ratio?
    --> take thumbnail pictures of 4:3 ratio 
    --> fix thumbnail div to maintain the 4:3 ratio
    -->

1. weird sliding resizing thing for thumbnail, when you slowly reduce the length of the screen
2. how to make the project items in a row the same size and bottom right align the logos
3. need to reorganize nesting of headings and sections 

# roadmap for now

## logos 
* if need to change them, replace the same name so the webpage updates accordingly
